# Talks 
---

This is the space to archive all __slides__ presented during our events 🗃 and propose
the __talks__ to give at __`Tunisia JS Community`__ meetups 🎗.


We want __YOU__ to come talk or present at a future __Tunisia JS Community__
event 👋🏻. <small>(Seriously, we want you to do it.)</small>


## Format of the talks

We have 4 talks where two of them are about the JavaScript ecosystem, one
for other topics like ~Ops and the last one is about OSS and that's part
of the initiative that we launched in Tunisia.

Each talk lasts 30 minutes or less. However, exceptions can be evaluated.

Our events occur on the first Saturday of the month. <small>(Soon, we will 
add a list of our meetups)</small>

> You can navigate the *archive folder* and read the *README.md* from each *talk_n folder*.

## How to submit a talk

It's easy. open an issue to propose a talk.

You have to give them the following info: 
  - Topic: [Topic of the talk]
  - Title: [Title of the talk]
  - Bio: [Bio of the speaker]
  - Photo: [Photo of the speaker]
  - Twitter: [Username of the speaker] <small>(or any other real time communication way)</small>

If you have any questions regarding your talk or the event, please add a comment in the issue and we will keep in connect.

> After the event, we share a URL to your slides. Thank you ^^! 

__`Note: If you'd prefer not to use GitHub for any reason, you can also submit talks via Google Form [here](google-form-link)`__
