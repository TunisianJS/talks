# Talks

> This repository maintained by [Imed Jaberi](https://www.3imed-jaberi.com) 👷🏻.

This is the space to archive all **slides** presented during our events 🗃 and propose
the **talks** to give at **`Tunisia JS Community`** meetups 🎗.

We want **YOU** to come talk or present at a future **Tunisia JS Community**
event 👋🏻. <small>(Seriously, we want you to do it.)</small>

## Talk Format

We have 4 talks where two of them are about the JavaScript ecosystem, one
for other topics like ~Ops and the last one is about OSS and that's part
of the initiative that we launched in Tunisia.

Each talk lasts 30 minutes or less. However, exceptions can be evaluated.

Our events occur on the first Saturday of the month. <small>(Soon, we will
add a list of our meetups)</small>

> You can navigate the _archive folder_ and read the _README.md_ from each _talk_n folder_.

Talks are recorded and posted onto our [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeWHKEOX998dAebsYhI6gKw) and/or [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/TunisianJS/live_videos).

## Some loose talk guidelines

- We welcome talks from anywhere in the world, and can be live, or prerecorded.
- We prefer hands on demos and live code-in-practice or a developer story to tell over org charts, process diagrams, product demos or corporate promo material.
- This is Tunisian JS Community - we are a broad group of developers and touch many technlogies in our day to day lives - but try and keep the link to Node and JavaScript central to your talk.

## First time speakers

Our meetup is inclusive and friendly. If you need some speaking mentorship - we're here to help. Our organizers can provide a hand in multiple ways: Review your talk, provide tips & advice regarding public speaking, help with slides and general presentation.

**How?** Simply add a comment below your talk proposal (the github issue) that you're looking for some advice when you submit a talk.

## How to submit a talk

It's simple and easy. [Open an issue](https://github.com/TunisianJS/talks/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=submit_talk.md&title=) to propose a talk.

You have to give them the following info:

- Title: [Title of the talk]
- Bio: [Bio of the speaker]
- Resume: [Abstract of your talk]
- Photo: [Photo of the speaker]
- Twitter: [Username of the speaker] <small>(or any other real time communication way)</small>

If you have any questions regarding your talk or the event, please add a comment in the issue and we will keep in connect.

> After the event, we share a URL to your slides. Thank you ^^ <3!

<!-- **`Note: If you'd prefer not to use GitHub for any reason, you can also submit talks via Google Form [here](google-form-link)`** -->
